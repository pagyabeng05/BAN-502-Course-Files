Read in data and examine structure

Basic model of Tv and radio to predict sales.  
```{r}
mod1 = lm(sales ~ TV + radio, ad)
summary(mod1)
```

Let's examine if there is an interaction effect between TV and radio ads. 
```{r}
mod2 = lm(sales ~ TV*radio, ad)
summary(mod2)
```

Not happy with the scientific notation?  
```{r}
options(scipen = 999)

mod2 = lm(sales ~ TV*radio, ad)
summary(mod2)

options(scipen = 1)
```
